/* Element data is sourced from the periodic-table package (https://www.npmjs.com/package/periodic-table)

  For now, I will likely use only elements 1-100 since their properties are more-or-less established (especially the transuranic elements)

  (16-Oct yeah.. maybe scratch that. The package doesn't have much info past bismuth (83), not even uranium >:( )

  Relevant data I will extract from each element:
  atomicNumber, symbol, name, atomicRadius, atomicMass, cpkHexColor (to color the atom), electronegativity, oxidation states, standardState?

  (Maybe standardState won't be needed since I'll have the atoms bounce around like balls)

  (Maybe not the electronegativity since I need it to pick an oxidation state)
