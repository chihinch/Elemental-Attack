            <h1>Atoms Demand Revenge!</h1>
            <p>
              A bunch of atoms are displeased that you didn't pay attention in chemistry class, so a rogue faction has set out to teach you a (chemistry) lesson.
            </p>
            <p>
              Atoms have a valence shell containing a certain amount of electrons. Defeat each atom by fulfilling the octet rule (i.e. give it 8 valence electrons).
            </p>
            <p>
              Defend yourself with two weapons: an ioniser and an electron gun.
            </p>
            <p>
              The ioniser uses the perfect amount of ionisation energy to remove one valence electron.
            </p>
            <p>
              Shoot atoms with the electron gun to fill their valence shell. Careful: you have a limited amount of electrons, but each successful hit from the ioniser will refill the electron gun.
            </p>
            <p>
              Atoms with positive oxidation states are immune to electrons. Atoms with negative oxidation states are immune to the ioniser.
            </p>
            <p>
              (Hint: the oxidation state tells you how many electrons you must add or remove to defeat an atom.)
